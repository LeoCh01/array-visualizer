# array-visualizer

this is mostly for leetcode questions when they give you a 1d/2d array testcase and I can't read it bc its huge and not aligned.

You can highlight squares by left click/swipe and unhighlight squares by right click/swipe.
There are different colors if you hold alt, shift, or tab.
